Some C programming problems:
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------

1. take two numbers as input and add them
2. take two numbers as input (float type), divide first number by the second number and show the result
3. findout fahrenheit to celsius, celsius to fahrenheit
4. take input of height, width and length and findout volume of a box
5. take length and width to find out area of a rectangle
6. findout out square of a number
7. take two numbers as input divide them and find out quotient and remainder 
8. findout reverse of a 3 digit number without using loop
9. findout the sum of digits of a number (2 digits or 3 digits)

10. Swap two variables

-> take a number as input and find if it is even or odd
-> take a number as input and check if it is positive or negative
-> Find factorial of a number
-> GCD,LCM of two numbers
-> check a year is leap year or not
-> power of a number, square of a number
-> calculate grade from given number

-> separte the odd and even numbers from an array and put it in other arrays called odd and even
-> separte the prime numbers from array
-> print fibonacci series using array
-> sum of number in fibonacci series until nth position 
-> findout a number is Armstrong number or not  
-> finout sum of the numbers in an array
-> findout largest, smallest, average number in an array
-> count even numbers or odd numbers in an array
-> reverse of an array
-> find prime numbers from 1 to n
-> check a number is palindrom or not
-> find decimal to octal, octal to decimal
-> find nCr, nPr for given value of n & r
-> copy elements of an array to another array
-> practice printing patterns given at the end of this file.

----------------------------------------------------------------
-> Now using function, solve all the above problems (Important)
----------------------------------------------------------------

for example: 
-> find factorial using a function
-> Find the Length of a String
-> reverse array using function
-> find maximum or minimum value of an array
-> Find Factorial of a Number Using Recursion
-> check a string palindrome or not
-> ASCII value of a character
-> Concatenate two strings
-> check an alphabet is vowel or consonant
-> Convert upper case to lower case and lower case to upper case
-> concatenate string without strcat()
-> reverse a string

-> findout exponential without power method
-> do addition and subtraction operation of matrices
-> do multiplication operation of matrices

-> check inputted character is vowel or consonant
-> findout number of total chaaracters in a string
-> compare two strings (same or not) 
-> use the functions strcpy(),strcmp(),stccat(),strncpy()
-> arrays of strings 
-> access each character of a string and print separately
-> Caesar cipher encryption and decryption 


-> Dynamic Memory Allocation, use of malloc(),calloc(),free(),realloc()
-> find maximum or minimum value using pointer
-> calculate sum of an array using a pointer of that array.

-> How to initialize/declare structure, taking input and output.
-> structure using pointer. create and assign value using pointers
-> create a student information managment system using structure where you can add info, show info, update info, delete info


----------------
pattern printing
----------------
-> take input n from user, then print the following patterns:

1) [n=5]
*
**
***
****
*****

2) [n=5]
*****
*****
*****
*****
*****

3) [n=5]

  *
 * *
*   *
 * *
  *

4)  [n=4]

****
***
**
*

5) [n=3]

  *
 ***
*****

6) [n=5]

    *

7) [n=5]

1
12
123
1234
12345



8) [n=3]

    1
  2 1 2
3 2 1 2 3
